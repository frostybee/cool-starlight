## 1. **Selectors**
Selectors define which HTML elements the CSS rules apply to. Here are the different types of selectors:

- **Type (Element) Selector**: Targets an element by its tag name.
  ```css
  p {
    color: blue;
  }
  ```
  This targets all `<p>` elements.

- **Class Selector**: Targets elements by their class attribute.
  ```css
  .example {
    font-size: 16px;
  }
  ```
  This targets all elements with the class "example" (e.g., `<div class="example">`).

```js
const button = document.createElement('button');
button.textContent = 'Click me';
document.body.appendChild(button);
```

```php  title="docusaurus.config.ts"
try {
    // Outer try block
    echo "Outer try block <br/>";

    try {
        // Inner try block
        echo "Inner try block";
        throw new RuntimeException("An error occurred in the inner block");
    } catch (RuntimeException $e) {
        // Handle inner exception
        echo "Caught in inner catch: " . $e->getMessage() . "<br/>";
    }

    // This code will still run even if inner block throws an exception
    echo "Continuing in outer try block <br/>";
    
    // Simulate another error
    throw new Exception("An error occurred in the outer block");
    
} catch (Exception $e) {
    // Handle outer exception
    echo "Caught in outer catch: " . $e->getMessage() . " <br/>";
}
```


```php title="Example: Handling exceptions in PHP"
try {
    // Outer try block
    echo "Outer try block <br/>";

    try {
        // Inner try block
        echo "Inner try block";
        throw new RuntimeException("An error occurred in the inner block");
    } catch (RuntimeException $e) {
        // Handle inner exception
        echo "Caught in inner catch: " . $e->getMessage() . "<br/>";
    }

    // This code will still run even if inner block throws an exception
    echo "Continuing in outer try block <br/>";
    
    // Simulate another error
    throw new Exception("An error occurred in the outer block");
    
} catch (Exception $e) {
    // Handle outer exception
    echo "Caught in outer catch: " . $e->getMessage() . " <br/>";
